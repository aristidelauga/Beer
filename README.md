# Beer App üçª

## Overview

Welcome to the **Beer App**, a modern and intuitive application designed to help you discover and learn more about your favorite beers. The app is powered by the Punk API, which provides detailed information on a wide array of beers. It's developed using SwiftUI, applying the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern, and follows the principles of clean architecture for sustainable and scalable software development.

## Technologies

- **SwiftUI**: This app is built entirely using SwiftUI, Apple's innovative and easy-to-use framework for designing user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.
- **MVVM Design Pattern**: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a tested and reliable design pattern that separates objects into three distinct groups: Models hold application data, Views display visual elements, and ViewModels transform Model information into values that can be displayed on a View.
- **Clean Architecture**: By following the principles of Clean Architecture, the Beer App maintains a clear separation of concerns within the codebase, leading to code that is easier to understand, manage, and extend.
- **API Requests**: The app connects to the Punk API to fetch detailed beer data. Asynchronous programming is used to manage API calls and provide a seamless and responsive user experience.
Features
- **Comprehensive Beer Catalog**: Explore a wide variety of beers, each with a detailed profile page containing brewing methods, ingredients, flavor profiles, and more.
- **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The Beer App uses modern asynchronous techniques to fetch data from the Punk API, ensuring a responsive and smooth user experience.
- **Programmatic Navigation**: Unlike the traditional NavigationView approach, the Beer App uses a NavigationStack for programmatic navigation, which provides increased flexibility and control over the app's navigational logic.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have Xcode installed. Then, clone this repository and open the .xcodeproj file in Xcode. From there, you can choose to run the app in a simulator or on a physical device.

Happy beer hunting üçª!
